# Geometric Texture Synthesis by Example

Code for CSE333 Course Project, Milestones 1 and 2

# Setup

`cd` to the root directory (`viz/`)
run the command `cmake CMakeLists.txt`. This should generate a bunch of build files. Then, run `make`. This should generate an executable called `geom-tex-synth`.

To run the program, type in `./geom-tex-synth` in the terminal.
